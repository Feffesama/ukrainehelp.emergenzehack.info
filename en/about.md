## The Project

This is a non-profit project, organized and directed entirely by volunteers and volunteers. It was created to share useful and verified information about the emergencies.

The aim is to verify, aggregate and label reports of various kinds, in order to put in contact requests for help and offers of goods and services.

It also collects and publishes solidarity and cultural initiatives aimed at promoting and implementing telecommuting and distance education.

Finally, we collect regulations, institutional directives and data.

We do not intend in any way to replace institutional sources of information to which we strongly refer for reliability.

## Reuse

Every software components we develop is released under an Open Source license that allows its reuse and promotes its development publicly.

The data we collect and produce are published and kept updated as [[Open Data](https://europehelp.info/opendata/)].

Where deemed useful, the entire infrastructure is reusable by organizations, associations, informal groups and even public administrations that need a service to inform and respond to the emergencies.

The project is described through our [[wiki](https://www.europehelp.info/en/wiki/)].

The idea and also a large part of the project is from the same team that developed the [Terremoto Centro Italia](https://www.terremotocentroitalia.info/)
and [Covid19Italia.Help](www.covid19italia.help) projects.
